## Crust - Common template and utility library for C++, inspired by Rust

If you're familiar with the Rust language, Crust is a C++ template library that offers some nice ideas from Rust (and by extension the many languages Rust is inspired from) for C++ via the template system. Example: Crust offers limited disjoint union types, array slices (mutable and immutable), etc.

Beyond the original inspiration as a template library, Crust includes many common higher level functions that should make life far easier for command-line tool developers: Command-line argument parsing, colored text output, formatted text output (e.g. margins, banner headers), etc.
